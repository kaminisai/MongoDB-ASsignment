Q) How to export data from MongoDB or databases?
A)To export the database, simply tell mongodump which database (or collection) you want to export, and where to export it to.
Example:-

 Mine was the notes database, so my command looks like this:

mongodump -d notes -o notebook
This dumps the notes database into the notebook directory. Take a look at what we have in that directory now:

notes
+-- books.bson
+-- system.indexes.bson

0 directories, 2 files
The only collection in my pets database is the books collection, 
however you'll see a .bson file for each collection in your database, 
plus the system indexes collection. It is up to you whether you want to take individual collections, 
or a whole database, but bear in mind that your choice will dictate whether you get information about indexes etc
 when you import the data elsewhere.


Q)How to import data from database in mongoDB?
A)To import, simply use the mongorestore command, which accepts either a single .bson file 
representing a collection, or a directory containing multiple files. 
Here's my example:

mongorestore -d notes /path/to/notes
You can specify any database name and path to files you like, so for taking backups or restoring additional copies of a database.
